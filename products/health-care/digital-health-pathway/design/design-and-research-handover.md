Where are we with the pilot? 

The pilot has been put on pause as of 08/24/2023 


·        
We have onboarded tier 1 (Orlando), tier 2 (Cleveland), tier 3a (SLC) and tier 3b (WRIISC) Veterans.  


·        
We have conducted interviews for Tier 3 Veterans  


·        
We have onboarded all clinicians to the dashboard 


There were plans for in September 2023, since it will have been 6 months since the first tier Veterans were onboarded, to send surveys and schedule interviews. Questions have been already identified and live in the
interviews/surveys
 folder in Teams.  NOTE: Moving forward, we need to be compliant with the Paperwork Reduction Act so there is more thinking to be done around how many interviews we do at a time and how we frame them.  


 


What insights did we gather during the pilot? 

High-level findings gathered from clinicians and Veterans during the pilot can be found
