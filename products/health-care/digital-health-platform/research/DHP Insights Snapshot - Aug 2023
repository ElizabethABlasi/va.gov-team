Insights Snapshot - August 2023

The insights snapshot is a collection of feedback we’ve received on DHP since we kicked off the pilot in March 2023. The DHP launched at 4 different VAMC’s across various programs, and we have continually gathered Clinician and Veteran feedback over the the last few months to inform and measure the success of the MVP. We spoke to 26 Veterans and 6 clinicians since March 2023. 

Who did we interacted with over the course of the pilot?
On the Veteran side, 54 % of our pilot participants were male, 46% were female, and they ranged in ages from 35 to 65+
- 29% identified as black or African American
- 14% identified as hispanic or Latino
- 48% while
- 9% preferred not to say

We had Veteran participants across 4 military branches, including the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines. On the clinician side, our clinician participants represented four 3 programs across 4 VA medical centers, including adaptive sports, whole health, and the WRIISC group.

At the origin of the DHP Pilot, we set 3 pilot goals and aims to guide the evolution of DHP, and how the pilot could not only prove success with our pilot Vendor, Fitbit, but also support the rapid integration of new cases, while delivering perceived value to clinicians and Veterans. For each of the 3 key pilot aims, we set measures of success and hypothesis to test and validated, in order to measure the resulting outcomes based on clinician and Veteran feedback. Overall, based on qualitiative and quantivation evaluation methods we used throughout the pilot and Clinician and Veteran feedback, we successfully achieved our pilot aims.

This PPT deck provides a high-level overview of feedback and insights gathered from Veterans and clinicians since the DHP pilot kicked off in March of 2023.
